# netfilterqueue
A lot of persons have had some difficulty with netfilterqueue
Woden e-mailed me today and said,
" Can you try installing like this?

sudo pip3 install --upgrade -U git+https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue
This worked for me.

BMFI said, "I tried the copy and past code from pypi and it was still throwing error"

Installing from pip still had this problem as of 1/15."

BMFI said, "I tried the copy and past code from pypi.org as of 01/21/22 and it was still throwing error"

sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev
