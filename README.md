# netfilterqueue
A lot of persons have had some difficulty with netfilterqueue
Josh from netfilterqueue contacted me and let me know it is fixed Josh said "it will be on pypi shortly". Besides, Woden e-mailed me today and said,
" Can you try installing like this?

sudo pip3 install --upgrade -U git+https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue
This worked for me.

Installing from pip still had this problem as of 1/15."

That deprecates the netfilerqueue wiki, but you can use it to altinstall py3.6 with py3.9(2.7). Moreover:
